# The Problem

-   War deaths are an unruly thing to model.
-   When @cunen2020 turned to an unconventional model called the inverse Burr to study war size, they were drawing from a deep well of actuarial science techniques to solve this problem.
-   But they say little about what this means, and offer even less practical advice and an easy to use user interface for working with the model.

# My Solution

-   I created an R package (`{invburreg}`) that implements an inverse Burr regression in ways that are consistent with other modeling functions in R.
-   I offer guidance on how to talk about model specification.
-   And guidance on summarizing model results.

# Background

-   **What's different about an actuarial approach to modeling war size?**
-   We political scientists tend to focus on expected outcomes --- e.g., conditional averages.
-   (From what I can tell) Actuaries take a whole-of-distribution approach to assessing risk.
-   Actuaries need flexible models that can accommodate potentially unruly data.

# Why does this matter for war?

-   There's arowing literature testing the *decline of war thesis* [@braumoeller2019; @cederman2003; @cedermanEtAl2011; @cirillo2016statistical; @clauset2017enduring; @clauset2018trends; @spagat2020decline; @spagat2018fundamental].
-   The decline of war debate is concerned with whether wars are becoming less frequent over time and less deadly.
-   When it comes to testing the second part of this argument, there's a problem.
-   **Wars are prone to power-law behavior in the extreme tail of the distribution.**

# The typical approach

Most applied research uses the classic power-law model to test whether there has been a change in the expected size of war over time:

$$\text{Pr}(X > x) \propto 1 / x^\alpha \quad : \quad \alpha > 0, \forall \text{ large } x$$

Because of practical limitations, the power-law usually must be fit to outcomes greater than some threshold identified by way of GOF tests.

# Limitations

-   Data truncation is necessary but comes at a cost to precision.
-   Up to half of wars in the data remain unexplained.
-   The classic power-law isn't amenable to covariates in a regression framework.

# The solution

-   @cunen2020 proposed using the inverse Burr as an alternative to the classic power-law for modeling war size.
-   The inverse Burr is a **three parameter** distribution that can accommodate thick-tailed data while being flexible enough to capture an interior mode (unlike the classic power-law).
-   It also can be modified to incorporate covariates into its estimation (also unlike the classic power-law).

# The solution

The inverse Burr specifies that the probability of some event bigger than size $x$ is:

$$
\text{Pr}(X>x) = 1 - \left[\frac{(x/\mu)^\theta}{1 + (x / \mu)^\theta} \right]^\alpha
$$

$\alpha$ and $\theta$ are shape parameters that primarily (but not exclusively) influence the left and right-hand sides of the distribution, and $\mu$ is a scale parameter that influences the mode.

# The solution

# The solution

The simple inverse Burr does under-predict the most extreme wars, but @cunen2020 showed how the inverse Burr parameters can be fit using covariates (which also improves the overall fit of the model).

$$
\mu_{L,i} = \mu_{L,0}\text{exp}(\beta_L w_i) \quad \text{and} \quad \mu_{R,i} = \mu_{R,0}\text{exp}(\beta_Rw_i)
$$

with constant $\alpha$.

# Making the solution accessible

-   @cunen2020 provide replication materials and a short summary of their approach.
-   But their goal was not to provide guidance on how to use this kind of model --- it was to test the decline of war thesis.
-   They offer little general advice about the model and how to specify an inverse Burr regression.
-   They provide their R code, but it isn't exactly tidy and easy to use.
-   They don't address appropriate ways to summarize model results.

# Making the solution accessible

1.  Model specification – both formally and using an R package I created called `{invburreg}`.
2.  Model estimation – by way of maximum likelihood using bootstrapping for inference.
3.  Model evaluation – simulating outcomes conditional model covariates.

# Model specification

The inverse Burr density function with conditional model parameters:

$$
\text{Burr}^{-1}(x_i; \mu_i, \alpha_i, \theta_i) = \frac{\alpha_i \theta_i(x_i / \mu_i)^{\alpha_i\theta_i}}{x_i[1 + (x_i / \mu_i)^{\theta_i}]^{\alpha_i + 1}} 
$$

where we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_i & = \text{exp}(\mathbf W '\beta) \\
\alpha_i & = \text{exp}(\mathbf Y ' \delta) \\
\theta_i & = \text{exp}(\mathbf Z'\gamma)
\end{aligned}
$$

# Model specification

Consider an applied example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_i & = \text{exp}[\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{post}_i + \beta_2 \text{polity}_i + \beta_3 \text{log}(\text{pop}_i)] \\
\alpha_i & = \text{exp}[\delta_0 + \delta_1 \text{post}_i + \delta_2 \text{polity}_i + \delta_3 \text{log}(\text{pop}_i)] \\
\theta_i & = \text{exp}[\gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \text{post}_i + \gamma_2 \text{polity}_i + \gamma_3 \text{log}(\text{pop}_i)]
\end{aligned}
$$

**The Outcome** is battle-related deaths for 95 wars in the CoW conflict series [@sarkeeswayman2010rw].

**The explanatory factors** are a post-1950 dummy, average belligerent polity [@marshalletal2017p], and the log of pooled belligerent populations [@singeretal1972cdu].

# Model specification

Using the `{invburreg}` package you can specify this model by writing:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

## open the package and access the wars example data
library(invburreg)
data("wars")

## fit an inverse Burr model to data
model_fit <- ibm(
  outcome = fat,
  mu = ~ post1950 + dem + pop,
  alpha = ~ post1950 + dem + pop,
  theta = ~ post1950 + dem + pop,
  data = wars
)
```

# Estimation

The recommended approach to estimating the parameters of the inverse Burr model is MLE [@dey2017dagum]:

$$
L = \sum_{i = 1}^n \text{log}[\text{Burr}^{-1}(x_i; \hat \mu_i, \hat \alpha_i, \hat \theta_i)]
$$

@cunen2020 use the Hessian for standard errors, but this doesn't always work in practice. `{invburreg}` relies on bootstrapping instead.

# Evaluating results

-   There are two useful ways to summarize results.

-   The first is by way of a regression table (these are obligatory in all political science studies after all).

-   The second is through simulating outcomes based on conditional inverse Burr parameters.

# Wrapping up

- The inverse Burr is a flexible tool used by actuaries to model risk in extreme-tailed data while modeling the whole of the distribution.
- It can be a great resource for conflict scholars studying correlates of war deaths.
- But a ready-to-use statistical package and guidance on best-practices is missing in the political science literature.
- This study is a first pass at making this a reality.
